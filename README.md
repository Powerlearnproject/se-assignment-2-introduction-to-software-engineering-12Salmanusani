ANSWERSoftware engineering: is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods,and tools to develop software system. it involves designing ,developing,testing,deploying and maintaining software to ensure it meets quality,reliability and efficiency standards.Software engineering:Software engineering is a disciplined approach to developing software systems using engineering principles and methodologies. It emphasizes systematic processes, rigorous testing, and adherence to quality standards to ensure reliable and maintainable software.It involves a structured approach to software development, focusing not only on coding but also on requirements analysis, design, testing, deployment, and maintenance.Software engineers often work in teams, follow coding standards, utilize version control, and employ tools for project management and documentation.
Differences from traditional programming:Traditional programming often focuses primarily on writing code to achieve specific functionalities without necessarily following a structured process.Software engineering, on the other hand, incorporates a broader set of activities and methodologies beyond just coding, including requirements gathering, design patterns, testing strategies, and project management techniques.Software engineering places a stronger emphasis on scalability, maintainability, and reliability of software systems compared to traditional programming.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):SDLC is a framework that defines the stages and processes involved in the development of software from conception to deployment and maintenance.It typically includes stages such as requirements gathering, analysis, design, implementation (coding), testing, deployment, and maintenance.SDLC frameworks (e.g., waterfall, agile) guide teams through these stages, ensuring systematic progression and alignment with project goals and customer requirements.SDLC frameworks vary in flexibility and emphasis on documentation, iteration, and customer collaboration, influencing how software projects are managed and executed.

Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):Requirements Gathering and Analysis:Involves gathering and understanding the requirements of the software from stakeholders.
System Design:Designing the architecture of the system based on the requirements gathered.
Implementation (Coding):Writing code based on the detailed design specifications.Includes unit testing to verify individual components.
Testing:Testing the integrated system to identify defects or bugs.
Deployment:Deploying the software to the production environment or releasing it to end-users.
Maintenance:Making modifications, fixing defects, and updating the software to ensure it remains useful over time..

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Waterfall Model:
Sequential Approach: Follows a linear and sequential process, where each phase (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment) flows downwards like a waterfall.Structured and Predictable: Well-defined stages and deliverables make it easier to manage and track progress.Rigid: Changes in requirements or design are challenging to accommodate once a phase is completed.Suitability: Best suited for projects where requirements are stable and well-understood upfront.
Agile Model
Iterative and Incremental: Emphasizes iterative development and frequent delivery of small, functional parts of the software (iterations or sprints).Flexible: Allows for changes in requirements and design throughout the development process.Collaborative: Encourages close collaboration between developers, stakeholders, and customers.Suitability:Â Ideal for projects where requirements are likely to evolve, and rapid delivery of working software is required
Requirements Engineering:
Requirements Engineering involves the process of eliciting, documenting, analyzing, and validating requirements for software systems. Key points include:
Elicitation: Gathering requirements from stakeholders through interviews, workshops, and surveys.Documentation: Recording requirements in a clear and structured manner to ensure understanding and traceability.Analysis: Analyzing requirements to ensure they are clear, complete, consistent, and feasible.Validation: Ensuring that the requirements meet the needs of stakeholders and can be implemented within constraints.
Waterfall: Requirements are typically gathered and defined upfront in detail before moving on to subsequent phases. Changes in requirements are generally not accommodated easily once the development process starts.Agile: Requirements are initially gathered, but there is more flexibility to refine and adjust them throughout the development lifecycle based on continuous feedback and evolving understanding.

Preferred Scenarios:Waterfall: Preferable for projects with well-understood and stable requirements, where a structured approach and predictable timeline are essential (e.g., regulatory compliance projects, certain government projects).Agile: Suitable for projects where requirements are likely to evolve, innovation and flexibility are critical, and there's a need for rapid delivery of functionality to adapt to market changes (e.g., software startups, product development in tech industries).
